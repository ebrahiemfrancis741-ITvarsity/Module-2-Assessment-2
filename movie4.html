                One night in his near-empty tower block in London, Adam has a chance 
                encounter with a mysterious neighbor Harry, which punctures the 
                rhythm of his everyday life. As a relationship develops between 
                them, Adam is preoccupied with memories of the past and finds himself 
                drawn back to the suburban town where he grew up, and the childhood 
                home where his parents appear to be living, just as they were on the 
                day they died, 30 years before.
